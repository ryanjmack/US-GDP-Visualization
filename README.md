# US GDP Data Visualization

This is a simple data visualization project I created using data from [The Federal Reserve Bank](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). This is a simple bar chart using the popular data visualization library [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## Getting Started

Check out the [live demo](https://ryanjmack.github.io/US-GDP-Visualization/)!

## Built With

* HTML/SCSS
* ES6 JavaScript
* D3.js
* Gulp for automating tasks


## Final Thoughts
This was a great mini project that helped me learn several things:

* Basic data visualization techniques
* Basic svg creation/manipulation (transforms in svg is not the same as css transforms for example!)
* The importance of quality data

Overall I had fun and I am going to make a couple more D3 projects this week.
